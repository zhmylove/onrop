ONline ROgue-like Pandemia game

# Instead of a foreword

Once upon a time, there was a boy who was fond of writing computer programs.
And that boy had a great dream to create a new open-world reach-gameplay game.
And the boy started to develop his ideas. 

Firstly there were embarked some game-plot ideas, which were created by the
boy and one of his youth best-friends, and the plot files were stored on a 3.5
inch floppy diskette, which is a rarity over this days.
Possibly this was a reason of the game Great Fault.
The school could only plant a seed; it must grow on its own.

Being a student, that yuppie come across well-grained format, suitable for his
ideas: rogue-like games. He utilized some basic technologies to create his
first rogue-like game. The game was not published for a mass and it's source
code is forgotten somewhere in the nooks and crannies of gigabytes of dusty
hard drives.

The time inevitably passed. Here one can see a story of young university
teacher, who inspired some of their students to participate in game-development
process alongst him. That project called itmmorgue and can be effortlessly
found on GitHub. The first minimum viable product emerged. And vanished as
quiet as it born. A fire cannot burn without an oxygen. Alas!

Finally, after PhD defence the storyline moves to a new game. Free time, lots
of ideas and previous experience...
The Universe will show us what will come out! 

# Summary

A plot is essentially the biggest problem of open-world games. Let it be two
intersected worlds in the Universe and, just like in the best fiction patterns,
one of them is a scientific-one, whilst the other is a magical. One of the
worlds experiences spreading death illness. A group of players, who are able to
traverse the interworld barrier somehow, tries to consolidate their magical
and scientific skills to eliminate the pandemia.
